# deezer favourites manager
Locally manage your Deezer favourites by categories

Currently (2025-10-23), Deezer doesn't have the option to arrange albums into categories.

I have created this script for my personal use and sharing it with everyone.

It's a Python script that can be run as is or compiled to an exe.

I am using Windows so I don't know how it will behave in other OSs.

I intend to manage the categories on my computer and view the file on my phone in Google Drive. Thus, the styling in the file that matches my use. Modify for your intended use.

The script reads the file deezer-favourites.html (if it exists) or creates it if it doesn't exist.

It sorts the categories and the artists in the category.

The UI doesn't enable editing the categories etc. If you want to change the data, just edit the html file and run the script again.

Enjoy.

Please note - I am not a programmer. The code was created by an LLM. It just works.

I hope Deezer will implement categories and this script will not be neccesary.
